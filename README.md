Similarly to [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/master) this repository is just a collection of header files.

FAQ
===

### Are the files free of charge?
Yes, they totally are, every file is licensed with the [**Unlicense**](unlicense.org) license.
I provide this software "as is" and don't give any warranties.
You are free to do whatever you want with them.

#include "ihc_libname.h"
```

C99
